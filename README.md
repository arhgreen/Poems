# THE TRAGEDIES THAT DEFINE OUR LIVES 
#### By Aaron H. Green 
It's the tragedies that define our lives; They are the fence-poles on whch the rest of our lives hang. I always think about that; Like, our lives just hang in there, between these really sad fence walls. Baby, you were born out of tragedy, multiple tragedies. All that loss, all that sadness and look at what you hang on your fence-poles. Look right infront you, look at what you did with all that. Do you see it? You are a brilliant resilient man. The world is a brilliant resilient place. We fight on!
Darkest before dawn, the sourest lemons life has to offer. This pain is not forever, this moment in time is not forever. Nothing is forever, Except us. We fight on!

Those of you who know me know that I am big on control. Its taken me 28 years to accept the fact that there is absolutely no point in trying to control the future because no one knows where we will be, not even a year from now. BUt, what we can control are the people we choose. Choosing our people is the closet we come to controlling our destiny because while everything else might change, If you choose right then everything will stay the same; whether thats a year from now or ten years from now.
