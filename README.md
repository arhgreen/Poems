# THE TRAGEDIES THAT DEFINE OUT LIVES 
###### By Aaron H. Green 
It's the tragedies that define our lives; They are the fence-poles on whch the rest of our lives hang. I always think about that; Like, our lives just hang in there, between these really sad fence walls. Baby, you were born out of tragedy, multiple tragedies. All that loss, all that sadness and look at what you hang on your fence-poles. Look right infront you, look at what you did with all that. Do you see it? You are a brilliant resilient man. The world is a brilliant resilient place. We fight on!
Darkest before dawn, the sourest lemons life has to offer. This pain is not forever, this moment in time is not forever. Nothing is forever, Except us. We fight on!
