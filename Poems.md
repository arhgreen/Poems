## ECHOES OF A CURIOUS SOUL— Poems by Aaron H. Green
### THE TRAGEDIES THAT DEFINE OUR LIVES 
We are carved by shadows, etched by pain,  
Each heartbreak a chisel, each loss a stain.  
Life’s tragedies fall like relentless rain,    
Yet from the wreckage, we rise again.  

A mother weeps where silence grows,  
For the laughter her empty home once knows.  
Her arms are hollow, yet they hold  
The ghost of love that time won’t fold.  

A soldier walks with a shattered gait,  
Haunted by faces that whisper his fate.  
The medals gleam, but they cannot hide  
The war still raging deep inside.  

The lover abandoned, the child betrayed,  
The dreams we buried, the debts we’ve paid—  
Each sorrow we carry, heavy and real,  
Becomes the compass that shapes how we heal.  

We are not untouched; we are not the same,  
We wear our grief like cloaks of flame.  
But fire refines, it burns away fear,  
And leaves behind what’s pure, sincere.  

Every scar is a map, every tear a line,  
Charting the journey through the divine.  
For tragedy is the cruelest muse,  
Yet it grants us the truth we cannot refuse.  

The broken heart loves with fiercer fire,  
The grieving soul climbs higher and higher.  
The shattered dreamers rebuild their skies,  
Wiping the ashes from their eyes.  

So do not fear the pain you face,    
The empty chair, the unfilled space.    
These losses are threads in life’s vast art,  
Stitching wisdom into your heart.  

For the tragedies that tear us apart,  
Are the very forces that forge our heart.  
And when the night feels endless and vast,  
Remember: the stars are born from a fiery past.

### UNYIELDING BLOOM
Beneath the weight of an iron sky,  
Where stone smothers tender ground,  
A tiny seed dares to defy,  
Its strength in silence found.  

The wind snarls fierce, the rain strikes cold,  
Dreams quiver in their skin,  
Yet deeper still the roots take hold—  
True growth begins within.  

Each scar etched deep on weathered bark,  
Each tear the storm has spun,  
Are medals of battles fought in the dark,  
Proof of the rising sun.  

Resilience is not the shield we wear,  
Nor the absence of fear’s sting.  
It’s the soft, bold whisper: “I am still here,”  
And the courage that makes it sing.  

Let thunder roar, let shadows creep,  
Let doubt cast its longest night.  
The soul that bends but never breaks  
Will bloom toward the light.  

### UNFOLDING THE SILENT SUN
Beneath a sky of muted grey,  
Where shadows stretch and whispers play,  
The silent sun begins to rise,  
A fragile glow in clouded skies.  

No trumpet blares, no thunder calls,  
No roar resounds through canyon walls.  
It breathes in stillness, soft and slow,  
Unveiling light the world will know.  

Its rays, like hands, reach trembling wide,  
Through tangled trees where fears reside.  
It touches leaves with golden grace,  
Reviving life in every space.  

The silent sun does not demand,  
Nor force its light upon the land.  
It warms the cold, it mends the fray,  
And coaxes night to slip away.  

In quiet hearts where shadows rest,  
Its tender light ignites the quest:  
To heal, to hope, to rise once more,  
To find the strength we thought no more.  

For silence speaks where words have failed,  
Its gentle beams a truth unveiled.  
That even in the darkest place,  
A sun will rise with patient grace.  

So let the silent sun unfold,  
Its quiet fire both soft and bold.  
For in its glow, new paths are spun—  
Life begins with the silent sun.  

### LOVE 
I knew you before the first hello,  
In dreams that lingered where I dared not go.  
Your name was a melody I couldn’t sing,  
Yet my soul hummed it—an unspoken thing.  

You are not just a person, but a place,  
A hidden map in the lines of your face.  
Your laughter, a compass pointing true north,  
Guiding me home, drawing me forth.  

Love with you is not soft or tame,  
It’s the spark that sets the forest aflame.  
It’s chaos wrapped in a tender disguise,  
A quiet storm behind gentle eyes.  

When we touch, time bends and breaks,  
Eternity born in the space it takes  
For your fingertips to trace my skin,  
A thousand lifetimes all within.  

You are the alchemist of my heart,  
Turning the fractured into art.  
Every scar, each broken seam,  
You’ve spun into gold, a radiant gleam.  

Our love is not perfect, but raw and real,  
It’s the wound that aches and dares to heal.  
It’s arguing fiercely, then laughing in tears,  
It’s hope that endures through the weight of years.  

You’ve taught me love isn’t only a fire,  
But also the embers that never tire.  
A quiet warmth in the coldest night,  
The whispered promise: We’ll be all right.  

In your arms, I am vast and whole,  
A constellation reborn in your soul.  
And when the world fades, as all worlds do,  
I’ll still be stardust—circling you.  

So here we stand, on the edge of the unknown,  
Two travelers claiming love as our own.  
Not flawless, not finished, but endlessly true—  
Alchemy made of me and you.
