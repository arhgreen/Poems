# ECHOES OF A RESTLESS SOUL— Poems by Aaron H. Green
## THE TRAGEDIES THAT DEFINE OUR LIVES 
We are carved by shadows, etched by pain,  
Each heartbreak a chisel, each loss a stain.  
Life’s tragedies fall like relentless rain,    
Yet from the wreckage, we rise again.  

A mother weeps where silence grows,  
For the laughter her empty home once knows.  
Her arms are hollow, yet they hold  
The ghost of love that time won’t fold.  

A soldier walks with a shattered gait,  
Haunted by faces that whisper his fate.  
The medals gleam, but they cannot hide  
The war still raging deep inside.  

The lover abandoned, the child betrayed,  
The dreams we buried, the debts we’ve paid—  
Each sorrow we carry, heavy and real,  
Becomes the compass that shapes how we heal.  

We are not untouched; we are not the same,  
We wear our grief like cloaks of flame.  
But fire refines, it burns away fear,  
And leaves behind what’s pure, sincere.  

Every scar is a map, every tear a line,  
Charting the journey through the divine.  
For tragedy is the cruelest muse,  
Yet it grants us the truth we cannot refuse.  

The broken heart loves with fiercer fire,  
The grieving soul climbs higher and higher.  
The shattered dreamers rebuild their skies,  
Wiping the ashes from their eyes.  

So do not fear the pain you face,    
The empty chair, the unfilled space.    
These losses are threads in life’s vast art,  
Stitching wisdom into your heart.  

For the tragedies that tear us apart,  
Are the very forces that forge our heart.  
And when the night feels endless and vast,  
Remember: the stars are born from a fiery past.  

## UNYIELDING BLOOM
Beneath the weight of an iron sky,  
Where stone smothers tender ground,  
A tiny seed dares to defy,  
Its strength in silence found.  

The wind snarls fierce, the rain strikes cold,  
Dreams quiver in their skin,  
Yet deeper still the roots take hold—  
True growth begins within.  

Each scar etched deep on weathered bark,  
Each tear the storm has spun,  
Are medals of battles fought in the dark,  
Proof of the rising sun.  

Resilience is not the shield we wear,  
Nor the absence of fear’s sting.  
It’s the soft, bold whisper: “I am still here,”  
And the courage that makes it sing.  

Let thunder roar, let shadows creep,  
Let doubt cast its longest night.  
The soul that bends but never breaks  
Will bloom toward the light.
